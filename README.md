[Live Preview](https://23odinbasicinformationalsite.replit4kai.repl.co/)

In this project, I practice server-side routing. 

I learn:
1. A curl is a command-line tool that helps transfer the data from the server to the client and vice-versa. 
2. write and readfile are async.
3. __dirnameÂ is an environment variable that tells you the absolute path of the directory containing the currently executing file.

Try to append different pathnames to the end of the given url:
1. about
2. contact-me
3. anythong other than the above.
